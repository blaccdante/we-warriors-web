                <h3>About Marcus Thompson</h3>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> 17 | <strong>Location:</strong> Atlanta, Georgia | <strong>Passion:</strong> Youth Advocacy</p>
                <p><strong>Sickle Cell Type:</strong> HbSC | <strong>Years as Warrior:</strong> 17 years</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Dream Deferred</h2>
            <p>
                I was supposed to be a basketball star. At least, that's what everyone told me when I was 12 years old, standing 5'8" and dominating the middle school courts in Atlanta. I had the height, the skill, and the drive. What I also had, though none of us fully understood it then, was sickle cell disease that would soon teach me there are different kinds of strength.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first major crisis hit during a particularly intense summer tournament. I'd been pushing through fatigue for weeks, thinking it was just part of being an athlete. But that day, the pain in my bones felt like fire, and I collapsed on the court. The ambulance, the hospital, the diagnosis â€“ HbSC sickle cell disease â€“ changed everything.
            </p>

            <h2>Redefining Victory</h2>
            <p>
                Suddenly, basketball wasn't just about perfecting my jump shot anymore. It became a careful balance of hydration, rest, temperature control, and listening to my body in ways my teammates never had to consider. Some days I felt unstoppable, scoring 20 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Other days, I watched from the sidelines as my body recovered from a crisis that had knocked me down for a week.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hardest part wasn't the physical limitations â€“ it was the questions. "Can you still play?" "Will you make varsity?" "What about college scouts?" Everyone wanted to know what sickle cell disease meant for my basketball dreams, but honestly, I was still figuring it out myself.
            </p>

            <h2>Finding My True Court</h2>
            <p>
                During my sophomore year, I started speaking at my school's health classes about living with sickle cell disease. What began as a one-time presentation turned into something bigger when younger students started approaching me in the hallways, asking questions, sharing their own health challenges, and telling me how my story helped them feel less alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's when I realized I had been looking for strength in the wrong place. My real superpower wasn't my crossover dribble â€“ it was my ability to connect with people, to share my story in a way that made others feel understood and inspired.
            </p>

            <h2>Building the Team</h2>
            <p>
                Today, I still play basketball when my body allows, but I've also built something I'm even more proud of: a peer support network for teens with chronic illnesses. We meet monthly, share experiences, support each other through tough times, and celebrate victories that might seem small to others but are huge to us.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've learned that some of the strongest people I know have never touched a basketball. They're the kids who get up every day and face challenges that would bench most "healthy" people permanently. They show up to school after spending the night in the hospital. They smile through pain levels that would stop others in their tracks. They are the real champions.
            </p>

            <h2>The New Game Plan</h2>
            <p>
                As I prepare for college, my goals have evolved. I'm still hoping to walk on to a basketball team if my health allows, but I'm more excited about studying social work and youth counseling. I want to create programs that help young people with chronic illnesses navigate the unique challenges we face â€“ from managing symptoms while pursuing our dreams to dealing with the social isolation that can come with being "different."
            </p>

            <p>
                Sickle cell disease taught me that strength isn't about never falling down â€“ it's about how you get back up, how you help others get back up, and how you redefine success on your own terms.
            </p>

            <h2>Message to Young Warriors</h2>
            <p>
                To my fellow young warriors: your dreams don't have to die because of your diagnosis. They might change, they might evolve, but they don't have to disappear. Some days you'll feel like you can conquer the world. Other days, getting out of bed will be your biggest victory. Both are valid. Both matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Don't let anyone tell you what you can't do because of sickle cell disease. But also don't be afraid to adapt your dreams as you learn more about yourself and what makes you truly happy. Sometimes the path you're forced to take leads you to something even better than what you originally planned.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are warriors not because we never struggle, but because we keep fighting. Keep dreaming. Keep adapting. Keep inspiring others just by being authentically you.
            </p>
